53616456        random # seed (8 digits or less)
CAGE_SIZE           initial solvent square lattice (nx by ny)
NUMBER_OF_PEPTIDES             # of solvent to turn into surfactants
0.75            bond-length of surfactants (units of sigma)
PEPTIDE_LENGTH               # of tails to add to each head (length of surfactant - 1)
0               flag for 2nd nearest neighbor bonds (0=no, 1=yes)
